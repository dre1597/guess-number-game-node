# guess-game-node

Just a simple guess a number game using input/output with nodejs without frameworks.

## About

The start of this was a lesson from this [node course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-node-js) on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).

I just made some modifications and test out some things.

## Setup

You will need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and on a terminal just run

```
node app.js
```
